## Robert Starbuck
### Web Developer
#### Born 1983

- Bristol, BS5
- https://robstarbuck.uk

**Frontend focussed developer and designer**. With a background in design, I have a good eye for what works on a site. I'd fit in best with a small team. I'm experienced with React, Next.js, Apollo GraphQL, Typescript, JS, CSS, UX Development and Graphics Suites. I'm currently developing using web-components built with lit.dev.

# Experience

## [Rippl](https://rippl.work/) - Incentives Platform
### Frontend Developer
#### July 2022 - Present, Remote

**UI development with web-components built in lit.dev**. Building a bespoke component librxxary and implementing those components accross Rippl sites and with the help of a brilliant team. Working with native web-components has posed some challenges with a shift away from callbacks to event driven interactions.

## [Polecat](https://polecat.com/) - Reputation Management
### Frontend Developer
#### April 2017 - December 2021, Bristol

**UI development with React in Typescript, incorporating functional programming with RamdaJS, occasionally contributing as a graphic designer**. My contributions were various, and included visualisations with D3 and helping to refactor our sites to use React. The team was very gifted and I learnt a great deal. We strived to a fault for best practices and would always make time for stand-ups, retros and hackathons.

## [Buddi](https://www.buddi.co.uk) - GPS Solutions
### UI Developer
#### Oct 2015 - Aug 2016, London

**Full stack role building UIs and a new company website with Angular, Shopify and a Sagepay**. The site was originally written in Jekyll and later rewritten in Hugo.

## [web.cv](https://web.cv) - Personal Start-up
### Founder / Fullstack
#### Sep 2014 - Sep 2015, London

**Unsuccessful start-up venture with a team of one**. I built the front­end of web.cv with AngularJS with the hope of partnering with a backend engineer. Working by myself was good for discipline, though I certainly lacked the feedback I needed to either move the project forward or understand when to stop.

## [Merchant Cantos](https://merchantcantos.com) - Marketing Agency
### Fullstack Developer
#### Feb 2014 - Jun 2014, London

**Contract work as a front-end dev**. Clients included several big names from ebay to facebook. Deadlines were tight and I was hard­worked but fully enjoyed my time with the team.

## [Y.CO](https://y.co) - The Yacht Company
### Fullstack
#### Nov 2010 - Aug 2013, Monaco

**In-house developer for a yacht company based in Monaco**. My role within the company was diverse. I mostly worked autonomously, managing projects and building tools for charter destinations and another for charter yacht selections. Whilst at the company I learnt to speak French. Voilà.
