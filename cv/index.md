## Robert Starbuck
### Web Developer
#### Born 1983

I'm a decent all rounder striving to keep things simple. My passion at the moment is Go though my career has been spent using JS. Given my background in design, I have a good eye for what works on a site. I'd most benefit a small team. I'm experienced with React, Apollo GraphQL, Typescript, JS, CSS, Go, UI Development and Graphics Suites.

# Experience

## [Polecat](https://polecat.com/) - Reputation Management
### Frontend Developer
#### April 2017 - Present, Bristol

UI development with React, Typescript and functional programming with RamdaJS, occasionally contributing as a graphic designer. The company took an iterative approach to development. The members of the team were incredibly gifted and I learnt a great deal. We were always striving for best practices and would make time for stand-ups, retros and hackathons.

## [Buddi](https://www.buddi.co.uk) - GPS Solutions
### UI Developer
#### Oct 2015 - Aug 2016, London

Full­stack developer building UIs and a new company website with Angular, Shopify and a Sagepay. The site was originally written in Jekyll and later rewritten in Hugo.

## [web.cv](https://web.cv) - Personal Start-up
### Founder / Fullstack
#### Sep 2014 - Sep 2015, London

I began building the front­end of web.cv with AngularJS in the hope of finding a business partner to implement the back­end. Working by myself was good for discipline, though I missed the feedback usually provided by a team. The project honed front­end skills as well as soft­ skills so important when working under your own steam.

## [Merchant Cantos](https://merchantcantos.com) - Marketing Agency
### Fullstack Developer
#### Feb 2014 - Jun 2014, London

Hired as a contractor to build a site with a tight deadline for an online auction company. The site went live on­time and its success led to my working with the firm’s largest contracts. I was hard­worked and enjoyed my time with the team and company.

## [Y.CO](https://y.co) - The Yacht Company
### Fullstack
#### Nov 2010 - Aug 2013, Monaco

An in­house developer for a Superyacht company based in Monaco, my role within the company was diverse. Working with JavaScript and PHP it saw me working autonomously as well as managing projects and consulting with various departments. Whilst at the company I learnt to speak French. Voilà.

## [Acquire Services](https://www.compass-group.co.uk/) - Procurement
### UI Developer
#### Aug 2007 - Oct 2010, Skipton

Despite limited web­knowledge at the time I learnt fast, picking up jQuery and MySql. The work involved navigating some truly labyrinthine code to fix bugs and improve performance. Despite having never used a query language I left as someone who could be trusted to write or refactor a complex query.

## [Sky Sports](https://skysports.com)
### ActionScript Developer
#### June 2006 - Aug 2007, Harrogate

I obtained this work placement as a means of learning Flash ActionScript, luckily it wasn’t long until I moved onto JavaScript as well. The department was always busy and I helped out on a number of projects that went on to be published.
